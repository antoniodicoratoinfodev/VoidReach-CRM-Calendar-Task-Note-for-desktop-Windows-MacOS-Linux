# VoidReach

VoidReach is a desktop CRM application developed with Java 21 and JavaFX. It currently provides local contact, calendar, and task management, account authentication, and persistent data storage on the user's computer.

> Current status: the **Contacts** and **Calendar** sections are operational. The other navigation items are present in the interface but still display an “under development” placeholder.

## Available Features

### Account and Authentication

- Registration with name, email address, and a password of at least 8 characters.
- Login and logout.
- Password recovery through a six-digit code that remains valid for 15 minutes. In this local version, the code is displayed directly in the application; no email is sent.
- Password changes and name updates from the account menu.
- **Stay signed in on this device** option: only the account email is stored, never the password.
- Passwords and password-recovery codes are stored as PBKDF2-derived values with a salt.

### Contacts

- Table showing name, company, job title, email, phone, last interaction, and tags.
- Contact creation and editing through a dialog.
- Available fields: name, company, job title, email, phone, tag, and description.
- Available tags: `Client`, `Tech`, and `Follow-up`.
- Real-time search by name, company, email, and description.
- Pagination with 15, 25, 50, or 100 contacts, or all contacts.
- Single or multiple selection and deletion with confirmation.
- Double-click a row to edit a contact.
- Copy selected contacts to the clipboard with `Ctrl+C` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+C` on macOS.

### Calendar and Task Management

- **Day** and **Week** views on a 24-hour grid with 15-minute intervals.
- Create a task by clicking on the timeline.
- Edit tasks with a double-click or right-click.
- Reschedule tasks with drag and drop.
- Resize a task by dragging its bottom edge.
- Edit the date, start time, end time, description, and color.
- Tasks must last at least 5 minutes and remain within the same day.
- Available colors: `Blue`, `Red`, `Green`, `Yellow`, `Orange`, and `Purple`.
- Navigate to the previous or next day and return to today.
- Timeline zoom from 0.75x to 3x with `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + mouse wheel; `Ctrl+0`/`Cmd+0` resets the zoom.

### Sidebar and Theme

- Monthly mini-calendar with month navigation.
- Selected day and current day highlighting.
- List of tasks for the selected day; clicking a task opens the Calendar view.
- Dark and light themes selectable from the sidebar.
- Profile avatar support for PNG and JPG images, with preview, circular cropping, and zoom.

### Sections Not Yet Implemented

The **Home**, **Dashboard**, **Leads**, **Opportunities**, **Accounts**, **Tasks**, and **Settings** items are navigable but currently display a placeholder. **Tasks** is not a standalone section: task management is integrated into the **Calendar**.

The application does not currently include Google Calendar synchronization, a remote database, email delivery, or online multi-user management.

## Local Persistence and Security

Data is stored in the `.voidreach-crm` directory inside the user's home directory:

```text
~/.voidreach-crm/
├── users.properties                         # accounts and derived credentials
├── users.properties.bak                     # previous revision, when available
├── session.properties                      # remembered-session email
├── data/<account-id>.properties             # contacts, tasks, and calendar preferences
├── data/<account-id>.properties.bak         # atomic backup of the data file
├── avatars/<account-id>-<uuid>.png          # cropped avatar saved as PNG
└── backup/<account-id>/                     # automatic CRM data backups
    └── crm-data-<timestamp>.properties      # up to 3 copies are retained
```

Primary saves are atomic. If a file is corrupted, the application attempts to recover the previous `.bak` revision. Unreadable records are isolated in files with the `.corrupt.properties` suffix so that the remaining valid data can still be loaded when possible.

Avatars support PNG and JPG/JPEG images ranging from 300×300 to 20,000×20,000 pixels, with a maximum file size of 10 MB. Images are processed with bounded memory usage and saved as a PNG master image of up to 1024×1024 pixels.

## Requirements

- JDK 21 or newer
- Apache Maven
- An operating system with JavaFX support (macOS, Windows, or Linux)

## Running the Application

From the Maven module directory:

```bash
cd VoidReach-CRM-Final-No-FatJar
mvn clean javafx:run
```

Alternatively, on macOS/Linux:

```bash
cd VoidReach-CRM-Final-No-FatJar
./run.sh
```

The project can also be imported into IntelliJ IDEA as a Maven project by selecting the `pom.xml` file inside the `VoidReach-CRM-Final-No-FatJar` module.

## Tests
